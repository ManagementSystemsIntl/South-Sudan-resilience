# South Sudan resilience

The South Sudan Monitoring and Evaluation Support Project (MESP) is conducting a household resilience survey in 13 counties. The purpose of this household survey is to obtain baseline data in the target areas for the indicators included in the Mission's Performance Management Plan (PMP) and the Community Roadmap, in support of USAID/South Sudan's Strategic Framework (2020-2024). MESP has completed data collection in six counties, and as of October 2021 is carrying out data collection in the remaining seven counties. The study team is currently reviewing the data from six counties in advance of analysis of the full set of 13 counties. 

This repository presents exploratory and preparatory analysis of the USAID resilience baseline survey, in anticipation of presenting findings, conclusions, and recommendations to USAID/South Sudan in December 2021. Click on a link below to review output relating to each survey topic.

Following [(Tango International 2018)](https://www.fsnnetwork.org/sites/default/files/Methodology_Guide_Nov2018508.pdf){:target="_blank"}, the Aspirations Index is a summative index comprising 13 measurement items relating to people's aspirations, confidence to adapt, and a sense of control over one's life. The South Sudan baseline selected nine of the 13 items and created a summary index. This output reviews this summative index and conducts further tests to assess the potential for index creation through factor analysis.
