### Comment

There should be changes in food security between rainy season and dry season. Could we compare adjacent counties for example Budi and Kapoeta N. The second comparison could be Mayendit and Leer?

### Response

Compare food insecurity across counties:

```{r}
s1 <- svyglm(fies_raw ~ county - 1,
             design=svydat)
summary(s1)
```

Test each county difference for statistical significance

```{r}

s1_aov <- aov(s1) 

s1_comp <- data.frame(TukeyHSD(s1_aov)$county) %>%
  rownames_to_column("comparison") %>%
  filter(p.adj<.050001) %>%
  arrange(p.adj) 

s1_comp[,2:5] <- map(s1_comp[,2:5], function(x) round(x, 3))

s1_comp %>%
  gt()

```

We do see reduced food insecurity as we move from phase 1 data collection during the rainy season to phase 2 data collection during the dry season. This decline in food insecurity is found in Budi, Paynijar, and Wau.

```{r}
include_graphics(here("output/viz/food security/fies by day.png"))
```

```{r}
include_graphics(here("output/viz/food security/fies by day county.png"))
```

On a cursory view, this decline in food insecurity is noisy and could easily be statistical noise.

### Comment

The mission has a youth focus could we get education and livelihood disaggregated by youth?

### Response

The report and separate frequencies document has the overall frequencies of reported income sources across all household members.

```{r}
frq(hh$q_314) %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  select(3:5) %>%
  gt()
```

Here we compute mean age and primary school education completion rate for each source of income generation activity a household member reports.

```{r}
frq(hh$q_314)

out <- hh %>%
  mutate(income=as_character(q_314)) %>%
  group_by(income) %>%
  summarize(age_se = std.error(age),
            age=mean(age),
            n=n(),
            primary=mean(primary, na.rm=T)) 

out %>%
  select(1,3,5) %>%
  gt() %>%
  fmt_percent(3, decimals=1)
```

Income generation source by youth (10-29.

```{r}

frq(hh$q_314)

occ_yth <- hh %>%
  mutate(income=as_character(q_314)) %>%
  group_by(income) %>%
  summarize(youth = mean(youth)) %>%
  arrange(desc(youth))

occ_yth %>%
  gt() %>%
  fmt_percent(2, decimals=1)

```

### Comment

Drinking water for people or water for cattle?

Unclear, and could be both. It may shed light to look at conflicts across income generation source. Across the 20 income generation activities a household could select, factor analysis identifies that these income generation sources cluster around eight separate 'factors':

ML6: goats, sheep, cattle

ML7: other ag, other non ag, petty trade other

ML5: rent, remittances, salary

ML4: ag wage in village, ag wage out of village

ML1: wage out of village

ML3: farmer

ML8: honey, gift, fish

ML2: petty trade own goods

We can look at conflicts reported for households that belong to each of these factors. We'll start with water.

```{r}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(conflict_water_all = ifelse(is.na(q_602_2), 0, q_602_2))

frq(dat$conflict_water_all)

```

```{r}
out <- dat %>%
  group_by(conflict_water_all) %>%
  summarize(incrank_fac_livestock = mean(incrank_fac_livestock, na.rm=T),
            incrank_fac_selfemployed = mean(incrank_fac_selfemployed, na.rm=T),
            incrank_fac_rentremitsal = mean(incrank_fac_rentremitsal, na.rm=T),
            incrank_fac_agwage = mean(incrank_fac_agwage, na.rm=T),
            incrank_fac_wageout = mean(incrank_fac_wageout, na.rm=T),
            incrank_fac_farm = mean(incrank_fac_farm, na.rm=T),
            incrank_fac_honeygiftfish = mean(incrank_fac_honeygiftfish, na.rm=T),
            incrank_fac_pettytradeown = mean(incrank_fac_pettytradeown)) %>%
  t() %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column() %>%
  slice(2:9) %>%
  set_names(nm=c("Income factor", "No water conflict", "Water conflict")) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Water conflict`))


out %>%
  gt()
```

Households that generate income from livestock and from fish and honey sales tend to report conflicts over water. This is likely water for the income generation activity, not drinking water from the household.
