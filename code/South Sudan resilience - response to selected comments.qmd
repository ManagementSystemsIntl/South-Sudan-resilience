### Comment

There should be changes in food security between rainy season and dry season. Could we compare adjacent counties for example Budi and Kapoeta N. The second comparison could be Mayendit and Leer?

### Response

Compare food insecurity across counties:

```{r}
s1 <- svyglm(fies_raw ~ county - 1,
             design=svydat)
summary(s1)
```

Test each county difference for statistical significance

```{r}

s1_aov <- aov(s1) 

s1_comp <- data.frame(TukeyHSD(s1_aov)$county) %>%
  rownames_to_column("comparison") %>%
  filter(p.adj<.050001) %>%
  arrange(p.adj) 

s1_comp[,2:5] <- map(s1_comp[,2:5], function(x) round(x, 3))

s1_comp %>%
  gt()

```

We do see reduced food insecurity as we move from phase 1 data collection during the rainy season to phase 2 data collection during the dry season. This decline in food insecurity is found in Budi, Paynijar, and Wau.

```{r}
include_graphics(here("output/viz/food security/fies by day.png"))
```

```{r}
include_graphics(here("output/viz/food security/fies by day county.png"))
```

On a cursory view, this decline in food insecurity is noisy and could easily be statistical noise.

### Comment

The mission has a youth focus could we get education and livelihood disaggregated by youth?

### Response

```{r}
frq(hh$q_314)

out <- hh %>%
  mutate(income=as_character(q_314)) %>%
  group_by(income) %>%
  summarize(age_se = std.error(age),
            age=mean(age),
            n=n()) %>%
  arrange(age) %>%
  mutate(margin=round(age_se*1.96,2)) %>%
  select(1,3,5, 4)

out %>%
  gt()
```
